Since the occupation first began in June 1967, Israel’s ruthless policies of land confiscation, illegal settlement and dispossession, coupled with rampant discrimination, have inflicted immense suffering on Palestinians, depriving them of their basic rights.
Israel’s military rule disrupts every aspect of daily life in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It continues to affect whether, when and how Palestinians can travel to work or school, go abroad, visit their relatives, earn a living, attend a protest, access their farmland, or even access electricity or a clean water supply. It means daily humiliation, fear and oppression. People’s entire lives are effectively held hostage by Israel.
Even before the beginning of the current chapter of the Palestinian Occupation, Palestinians have suffered the daily horrors of this apartheid state. Since October 7th, following Hamas’ attack on a Music festival, the horrors have only increased in severity. Israeli has murdered over 15,000 people - 1/3 of these people being children - within Gaza. They have pushed Gaza’s continuously southward, and bombed the path they’ve left behind. On the data on this publication Gaza’s have been asked by Israeli forces to move to the southern city of Rafah. In addition to Israel bombing the zone of the Gaza striped they deemed as safe, there is no more water or food, and Israel has also closed the bordered to Egypt aside from the rare humanitarian aid truck.

        So Now you understand the severity of this humanitarian crisis, what can you do? How can you use the tools of the modern digital Age to not be complicate? First, I recommend educating yourself. The website (decolonizepalestine.com). They have a lot of resources on the history and current situation in Palestine. Next, we have to look at what the people who are experiencing the crisis are asking of the world. There are a few key Palestinian journalists/reporters that have been giving primary reports of the genoise. Bisan Owda, a 24 year old Palestinian filmmaker who has been documenting the conflict over social media. Photojournalist Motaz Azaiza, who has also being sharing videos on social media. In a recent post he says, “"Remember that we’re not content to be shared, we are a nation that is getting killed and we’re trying not to be ethnically cleansed…” 
With the power of technology in the modern digital age, we all have access to resources that we can educate and organize with. Through digital media organizers have done multiple sit-ins on the capital, you have access to information about your representatives. Use it! Call your representatives and call for a ceasefire. There are more things to do than be idle while this happens. Go to the website (https://act.uscpr.org/a/callforgaza) to do this.

            <p>So commonly in the West, with the over saturation of information, we get so quickly burned out in our efforts to help others not as privileged. DON’T LOOK AWAY. Palestinians can’t. </p>

                <figcaption class="figcaption">"One of the many Cobalt Mines in Congo, filled with children laborers."</figcaption>

            <p>  <span class="citation">"Cobalt mining provides the highest income in the area for children and other community members, with children earning up to $2.50 USD each per day."</span> </p>
            <p>The cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stand as a harrowing symbol of exploitation and humanitarian crises. These mines, vital for manufacturing batteries essential in modern technology, have a dark underbelly marked by the rampant use of child labor. Thousands of children, some as young as seven years old, toil in perilous conditions, exposed to hazards without adequate protective gear or safety measures. The pursuit of cobalt often leads to egregious human rights violations, with workers enduring grueling hours, abysmal pay, and hazardous environments. This reality intertwines with a broader humanitarian crisis, exacerbating poverty and fostering a cycle of exploitation that inflicts profound social, economic, and health hardships on the affected communities.</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Millions Displaced in South Sudan </span><p><span class="headline hl4"></span></p></div><p>Conflicts between government forces, rebel groups, and ethnic militias have resulted in widespread violence, leading to the displacement of millions of people within Sudan and across its borders. The ongoing conflicts have severely disrupted livelihoods, decimated infrastructure, and impeded access to basic services such as healthcare and education. Additionally, Sudan grapples with high levels of food insecurity, exacerbated by factors like climate change, economic challenges, and displacement, leaving millions at risk of famine and malnutrition. Humanitarian organizations face significant obstacles in delivering aid due to ongoing conflict, bureaucratic hurdles, and resource limitations, further exacerbating the suffering of vulnerable populations.</p></div>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">A Fight for Space + Attention</span><p><span class="headline hl4">How the Digital Age of Everything Dictates Crisis</span></p></div><p>In today's hyperconnected digital age, the saturation of information often creates a stark contrast between the visibility of crises in the Western world versus those in regions outside of it. People in less privileged parts of the globe often find themselves battling for attention and aid from the West, as media coverage tends to spotlight issues that resonate more with Western audiences. Simultaneously, the sheer volume of information inundating privileged societies leads to desensitization—wherein the constant exposure to suffering from various corners of the globe can dull empathy and create a sense of detachment.  </p>
          
          <p>However, this inundation is not an excuse for apathy. Instead, it underscores the need to leverage the tools and resources available in this digital age to amplify marginalized voices, spread awareness about global issues, and foster empathy on a broader scale. Empowering individuals to use social media, online platforms, and digital communication tools to share stories, advocate for change, and highlight humanitarian crises can bridge the empathy gap and drive collective action towards a more compassionate and globally conscious society.
